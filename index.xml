      <description>Small project done for fun within the Numérique pour tous association.
The LED Matrix (WS2812B) is driven by a single Arduino UNO which receives commands from the PC by the serial port.
The software used to compute the animations is GLEDiator.

      <description>During our 4th year at ISEN, we had to do an electronic/software project during the year.
The subject of this project was to create a home monitoring system based on a thermic and an ultrasonic sensor. The hardware was imposed and we had to create an I²C bloc on an Altera FPGA (the Cyclone V running the Nios II soft-processor).
If a person was detected, a SMS was send thanks to a GSM module communicating with the NIOS processor with an UART and AT-Commands.</description>

      <description>Serial Terminal The first thing we can do with a minitel is to use it as a Linux serial Terminal. It can be done with a small level shifter card to interface the tension of the minitel to the 3V3 needed by the Raspberry Pi. even if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t handle colors, you can use any Linux commands and play Dunnet or go on the web with Elinks.

      <description>6-weeks student project during the 3rd year at ISEN Brest. The project was done in groups of 2.
The project was divided in 3 parts:
 Electronic: design the card with CAO software, then sold the component on the PCB FPGA: Impelment the alogorithm in VHDL to process the IR variation and determine the heart beat. Software: The card was plugged to a computer with an FTDI serial interface, the role of the computer was just to compute the SPO2 arte and show the heart rate.</description>

      <description>This project is a C++ game done as part of the Club Elec of the ISEN Brest for the open house day.
The player control the tank by moving to the left or the right thanks to OpenCV (color tracking). To fire the player uses the left button of a mouse. The GUI is done with the SDL library.
Below are some screenshots of the game:
